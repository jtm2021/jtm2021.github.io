            Dear Recruitment Team, <br><br>

            Greetings! <br><br>

            I am excited to apply for the position advertised at your company portal. Although I come
            from a nursing background, I am passionate about web development and design, and I am eager to make a career
            change to pursue my interests. <br><br>
            As a nurse, I developed excellent communication skills and learned the
            importance of paying close attention to detail. These skills translate well to web design and development,
            where communication with clients and attention to detail are crucial to delivering quality work. <br><br>
            I have spent the last year taking online courses in web development and design, including HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript, and various design tools. In addition, I have worked on several projects, both individually and
            in teams, to further my skills and gain practical experience. Currently, I am mastering my skills in Java
            Programming with SpringBoot framework. <br><br>
            I am excited about the opportunity to bring my unique perspective and skills to the field of web development
            and design. I believe that my background in nursing, combined with my technical skills and passion for the
            field, make me an asset to any team. <br><br>
            Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications
            further and to learn more about the position at your company.<br><br><br>

            Kind regards, <br><br>
            Jesson Mangilisan
        </p>
